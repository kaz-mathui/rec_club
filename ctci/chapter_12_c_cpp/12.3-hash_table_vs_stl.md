In a hash table, a value stored by calling a hash function on a key. Values
are not stored in sorted order. Inserts and lookup can be done in amortized
O(1) time (assuming few collisions in the hash table). In a hash table, one
must handle collisions. This is done by chaining, which means to create a
linked list of all the values that map to a particular index.
An STL map inserts the key/value pairs into a binary search keys based on the
keys. There is no need to handle collisions. Insertion and lookup is O(nlog(n)).

How to implement a linked list?
A hash table is traditionally implemented with an array of linked lists, where
each node in the linked list holds two pieces of data: the value and the
original key.

- We want to use a good hash function to ensure the keys are well distributed.
- We may also wish to implement methods to dynamically increase or decrease
  the hash table size depending on capacity.
