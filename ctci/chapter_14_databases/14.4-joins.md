To perform a JOIN, each of the tables must have at least one field that will
be used to find matching records from the other table.

INNER JOIN: The result set would contain only the data where the criteria
match.
OUTER JOIN: An OUTER JOIN will always contain the results of INNER JOIN, but
it may also contain some records that have no matching record in the outer
table. OUTER JOINS are divided into the following subtypes:

- LEFT OUTER JOIN, or simply LEFT JOIN. The result will contain all records
  from the left table. If no matching records were found in the right table,
  then its fields will contain the NULL values.
- RIGHT OUTER JOIN, or simply RIGHT JOIN. This type of join is the opposite of
  LEFT JOIN. It will contain every record from the right table; the missing
  fields from the left table will be NULL. Note that if we have two tables, A
  and B, then we can say that the statement A LEFT B is equivalent to the
  statement B RIGHT JOIN A.
- FULL OUTER JOIN: This type of join combines the results of the LEFT and RIGHT
  JOINS. All records from both tables will be included in the result set,
  regardless of whether or not a matching record exists in the other table. If
  no matching record was found, then the corresponding result fields will have
  a NULL value.
