Denormalization is a database optimization technique in which we add redundant
data to one or more tables. This can help us avoid costly joins in a
relational database.

By contrast, in a traditional normalized database, we store data in separate
logical tables and attempt to minimize redundant data. We may strive to have
only one copy of each piece of data in the database.

Cons of Denormalization:

- Updates and inserts are more expensive
- Denormalization can make update and insert code harder to write
- Data may be inconsistent. Which is the "correct" value for a piece of data?
- Data redundancy necessitates more storage.
  Pros of Denormalization:
- Retrieving data is faster since we do fewer jobs.
- Queries to retrieve can be simpler (and therefore less likely to have bugs),
  since we need to look at fewer tables

In a system that demands scalability, we almost always use elements of both.
