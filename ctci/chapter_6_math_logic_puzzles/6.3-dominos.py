"""
The chessboard has 32 black and 32 white squares. By removing opposite corners,
(which must be the same color), we're left with 30 of one color and 32 of the 
other. Let's say, for the sake of argument, we have 30 black and 32 white.
Each domino we set wil always take up one black and one white square. Therefore,
31 dominos will take up 31 white square ans and 31 black squares. On this board, 
however, we must have 30 back and 32 white squares. Hence, it is impossible.
