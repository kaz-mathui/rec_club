A virtual function is a member function that is declared within a base class
and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived
class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a
virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the
function.

Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object
regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for the function call.

- They are mainly used to achieve runtime polymorphism
- Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in base class.
- A virtual function depends on a "vtable", which is constructed to store
  addresses of the virtual functions of a class
