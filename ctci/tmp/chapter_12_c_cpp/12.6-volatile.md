The keyword volatile informs the compiler that the value of a variable can be
changed from the outside, without any update done by the code. This may be
done by the operating system, the hardware, or another thread. Because the value
can change unexpectedly, the compiler will therefore reload the value each time
from memory.
Volatile variables are not optimized, which can be very useful.
Volatile variables are also useful when multi-threaded programs have global
variables and any thread can modify these shared variables. We may not want optimization on these variables.
