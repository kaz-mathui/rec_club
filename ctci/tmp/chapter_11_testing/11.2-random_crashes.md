Source of crashes:

1. Random variable that may not be fixed for every execution of the program.
2. Uninitialized variable that may take on an arbitrary value.
3. Memory leaks (Heap overflow or corruption of data on the stack)
4. External dependencies. The application may depend on another application,
   machine or resource.

Strategy to approach this is in a logical, structured manner, as opposed to
jumping all over, shouting out random suggestions.
