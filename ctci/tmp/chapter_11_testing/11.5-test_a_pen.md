Ask questions:

1. Who is going to use the pen?
2. What will they be doing with it? Will they be writing, drawing?
3. What are they drawing on? Paper? Clothing? Walls?
4. What kind of tip does the pen have? Felt? Ballpoint?

The key here is structure.

1. Fact check: Verify that the pen is felt tip and that the ink is one of the
   allowed colors.
2. Intended use: Drawing. Does the pen write properly on clothing?
3. Intended use: Washing. Does it wash off of clothing? Does it wash off in
   hot, warm, and cold water?
4. Safety. Is the pen (non-toxic) for children?
5. Unintended use: How else might children use the pen? They might write on
   other surfaces or stomp on the pen. You'll need to make sure that the pen
   holds up under these conditions.

Always test for intended and unintended uses.
