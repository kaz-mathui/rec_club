In the absence of testing tools, we can basically create our own. We could
simulate concurrent users by creating thousands of virtual users. We would
write a multi-threaded program with thousands of threads, where each
thread acts as a real-world user loading the page. For each user, we would
programmatically measure things such as response time, data I/O, etc.

Performance objectives include:

- response time
- throughput
- resource utilization
- maximum load that the system can bear
