Ask questions:

1. Who is going to use the ATM?
2. What are they going to use it for?
3. What tools do we have to test? Do we have access to the code, or just to
   the ATM?

Testable components:

1. Logging in
2. Withdrawing money
3. Depositing money
4. Checking balance
5. Transferring money

We will want to use a mix of manual and automated testing.
We need to prioritize security and reliability. A good tester understands the
system's priorities.
